# A simple but powerful mud client - refreshment

* Old version (`0.7.14`) is incompatible with newest ruby versions.
* Current build (`0.8.0.beta1`) is incompatibile with elder versions (< 2.0)

My goal is to refresh the codebase and add new features to it.

New versions will be developed and tested on Ruby `> 2.0`.
