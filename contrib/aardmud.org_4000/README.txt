This is a pack of scripts for the muby Ruby MUD Client and Aardwolf MUD.

Scripting home page:
http://jrandomhacker.info/Muby/Aardwolf

muby:
http://jrandomhacker.info/Muby
http://rubyforge.org/projects/muby

Aardwolf:
http://www.aardwolf.com
telnet://aardmud.org:4000
http://jrandomhacker.info/Aardwolf

To connect to Aardwolf within muby, you do:
/connect "aardmud.org", 4000


If this script pack is either symbolically linked or copied to your ~/mubyrc.d/ 
directory, then all scripts will automatically load and work when you launch 
muby.


See aard-config.rb for user settings.  Make this the first thing you review.

If you want to override parts of these scripts, then copy them to your own user 
scripting (in ~/mubyrc.d).  That way you can change my scripting without 
having to re-do your changes every time I update something.  If you think it's 
something everyone would enjoy, let me know  about your changes and they'll be 
included in a day or two, at least in the rubyforge Subversion repository.


Some scripting has not been done, because it wouldn't be universally 
appealing.  I've put examples where I could.
